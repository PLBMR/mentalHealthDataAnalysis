-Insurance Status, Use of Mental Health Services, and Unmet Need for Mental 
    Health Care in the United States
    --References
        ---13-15: attitudinal barriers
        ---17: high uninsured rate among people with mental disorders
        ---14: NSDUH
        ---19: talks about weighted response rate of NSDUH
        ---21-22: discusses effectiveness of SAMHSA's models
    --Data
        ---National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)
            ----"Provides nationally representative estimates of drug use and
                mental illness for the civilian, noninstitutionalized US
                population"
            ----All completed a K6 scale that measures psychological distress
            ----Completed WHODAS that assesses functional impairment
            ----SAMHSA built prediction models using K6 and WHODAS to estimate
                mental illness and serious mental illness
            ----For barriers, respondents could choose from six structural and
                eight attitudinal barriers
    --Main Results
        ---Studied NSDUH to:
            ----find what proportion of all adults and adults with mental
                illness receive mental helath treatment and perceive an unmet
                need for reatment
            ----what factors are associated with receiving mental health
                treatment and perceiving an unmet need?
            ----what barriers to treatment are encountered by adults with mental
                illness to report an unmet need for treatment?
            ----how do these patterns and barriers differ by insurance status?
        ---Used 2011 NSDUH, although we are now up to 2015
        ---"All logistic regression models were run separately for adults with
            any mental illness and with serious mental illness"
        ---Table 1 shows some interesting summary statistics
    --Questions:
        ---What is a weighted response rate?
        ---What is a Kessler-6 (K6) scale?
        ---How effective are SAMHSA's prediction models? are these models in the
            public domain?
        --Is the survey panelized?
        --What is a design-based F-statistic? How is it different from a typical
            F-statistic?
    --Opinion:
        ---I could use better methods
        ---I could consider some time-varying factors of NSDUH
        ---Might want to reproduce their tables in an analysis
