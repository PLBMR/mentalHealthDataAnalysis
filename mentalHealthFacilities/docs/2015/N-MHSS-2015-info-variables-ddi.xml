                    <abstract><![CDATA[<p>The <em>National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS)</em> is an annual survey designed to collect statistical information on the numbers and characteristics of all known mental health treatment facilities within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. In every other year, beginning in 2015, the survey also collects statistical information on the numbers and demographic characteristics of persons served in these treatment facilities as of a specified survey reference date. </p>
<p>The N-MHSS is the only source of national and State-level data on the mental health service delivery system reported by both publicly-operated and privately-operated specialty mental health treatment facilities, including: public psychiatric hospitals; private psychiatric hospitals, non-federal general hospitals with separate psychiatric units; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers; residential treatment centers for children; residential treatment centers for adults; outpatient or day treatment or partial hospitalization mental health facilities; and multi-setting (non-hospital) mental health facilities.
</p>
<p>The N-MHSS complements the information collected through SAMHSA's survey of substance abuse treatment facilities, the <em>National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS)</em>. Treatment facility Information from the N-MHSS is used to populate the mental health component of SAMHSA's online Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator. <ExtLink URI="http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/" /></p>]]></abstract>

                        <universe>The 2015 N-MHSS survey universe included 17,486 facilities across the United States and its jurisdictions. Most facilities in the 2015 N-MHSS frame were identified from the updated database produced after fielding the 2010, 2012, and 2014 N-MHSS, supplemented by the 2015 mental health augmentation and new facilities that states requested be added to the I-BHS.</universe>

                <notes>As with any data collection effort, certain procedural considerations and data limitations must be taken into account when interpreting data from the 2015 N-MHSS. Some general issues are listed below. Considerations and limitations of specific data items are discussed where the data are presented.</notes>
                <notes>Multiple responses were allowed for certain questionnaire items (e.g., services provided in non-English languages and type of payment or insurance accepted for mental health treatment services). Tabulations of data for these items include the total number of facilities reporting each response category.</notes>
                <notes>N-MHSS collects data about facilities, not individual clients. Data on clients represent an aggregate of clients in treatment for each reporting facility.</notes>
                <notes>The N-MHSS is a voluntary survey and while every effort is made to obtain responses from all known mental health treatment facilities, some facilities did not respond. There was no adjustment for the 8.1 percent facility non-response.</notes>
