# Data And Mental Health: The OSMI Survey 2016 - Part 2

_By [Michael Rosenberg](mailto:rosenberg.michael.m@gmail.com)_

# Introduction

Hi everyone! After performing a data analysis on the [Open Sourcing Mental
Illness](INSERT LINK HERE) (OSMI) survey [previously](
INSERT LINK HERE), I got a lot of good feedback on my techniques and decisions
within the data science community and the mental health landscape. I appreciate
all of your thoughts and opinions, and I hope to stay involved in the
conversation related to data and mental health.

After looking over other components of the [OSMI Survey on Mental Health](
INSERT LINK HERE), I recognized some other components of the dataset that could
be mined for meaningful results. In particular, I recognized that there were
many assets of the survey that took into account the opinions of respondents
towards the mental health landscape in the industry. Using this opinion data, I
was able to construct the analysis here today.
