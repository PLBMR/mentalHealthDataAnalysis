# Data And Mental Health: The OSMI Survey 2016 - Part 2

_By [Michael Rosenberg](mailto:rosenberg.michael.m@gmail.com)_

# Introduction

Hi everyone! After performing a data analysis on the [Open Sourcing Mental
Illness](https://osmihelp.org) (OSMI) survey [previously](
https://medium.com/@tfluffm/data-and-mental-health-the-osmi-survey-2016-39a3d308ac2f), 
I got a lot of good feedback on my techniques and decisions
within the data science community and the mental health landscape. I appreciate
all of your thoughts and opinions, and I hope to stay involved in the
conversation related to data and mental health.

After looking over other components of the [OSMI Survey on Mental Health](
https://osmihelp.org/projects/research), I recognized some other components of
the dataset that could be mined for meaningful results. In particular, I 
recognized that there were many assets of the survey that took into account the 
opinions of respondents towards the mental health landscape in the industry. 
Using this opinion data, I was able to construct the analysis here today.

As discussed in my previous analysis, I have some ground rules:

* If you would like clarification in this analysis, please leave a comment 
below! I want to be as clear as I can when writing a report.

* If you have any questions on techniques used or components studied, 
also leave a comment! I really appreciate conversations on data-mining 
strategies.

With that being said, let's dive into the data.

# The Dataset

I spent some time in my previous analysis describing the OSMI Survey in detail.
Hence, I would recommend that you read through
[that section](https://medium.com/@tfluffm/data-and-mental-health-the-osmi-survey-2016-39a3d308ac2f)
of the previous analysis if you want the full details on the survey.

As mentioned earlier, the OSMI Survey contains several questions pertaining to
how respondent perceive mental health support in the workplace. Some of these
questions pertain to:

* Whether or not an employer provides coverage for mental health conditions in
the workplace healthcare plan.

* Whether an employer is supportive of mental health in the workplace.

* Whether one's colleagues (e.g. team members, direct supervisors) are
supportive of mental health in the workplace.

* If one believes that mental health conditions are regarded as taboo in the
industry as a whole.

I am interested in whether or not there is a set of patterns to the answers of
these questions that might indicate narratives about mental health in the
technology industry. In particular, I wonder if there are clusters
of respondents that each have a different perspective on how mental health is
dealt with in the workplace. Once I have discovered these perspective clusters,
I hope to see whether the demographics of respondents predict these perspectives
in some meaningful manner.

# Data Exploration

One of the key limitations we have to deal with is that individuals who are
self-employed do not fill out most of the information related to their 
employer or colleagues. Thus, in order to analyze this dataset, we must remove
self-employed persons from the analysis. This drops our number of observations
from 1433 to 1146, which is a sizable drop. That being said, self-employment is
a very different style of work than the typical salaried individuals working for
companies. In this sense, including them in the analysis will lead to
complicated interpretations of our results. Thus, while it does lead to a loss
of data points, self-employed individuals should only be considered in future
analyses.

![figure1](../figures/figure1.png)

_Figure 1: Distribution of whether or not an employer provides mental health 
benefits as part of health coverage._

We see that while a sizable number of individuals have some form of mental
health benefits as part of their health coverage, a moderate amount of
individuals are either not sure about their coverage or do not have coverage on
mental health. This is immediately concerning for the tech industry, as it would
suggest that a lot of workplace health care plans are not adequate for taking
care of mental health.

![figure2](../figures/figure2.png)

_Figure 2: Distribution of whether or not an employer offers resources to
learn more about mental health concerns and options for seeking help._

We see that most respondents claim their employer does not provide meaningful
resources to educate on mental health and seek help. This again shows a trend
that employers are typically not providing the benefits nor alternative
resources to address mental health.

![figure3](../figures/figure3.png)

_Figure 3: Distribution of answers for the question "Do you think that 
discussing a mental health disorder with your employer would have negative
consequences?"_

We see that most individuals lean no on this question, but there are still a
large portion of the sample that believes there will be negative consequences
for discussing a mental health condition with their employers. What these
negative consequences might be would be useful to capture in a future survey.

![figure4](../figures/figure4.png)

_Figure 4: Distribution of confort level talking about mental health with
coworkers_

We see that from the colleague-oriented side of mental health, our sample seems
uncomfortable talking about mental health with coworkers. This suggests that
our sample feels a sense of taboo about discussing mental health around the
workplace beyond an employer's opinions.

![figure5](../figures/figure5.png)

_Figure 5: Distribution of whether or not an individual was willing to bring up
a mental health issue with a potential employer during an interview._

We see that most individuals believe that they wouldn't bring up a mental health
issue during an interview. For the most part, this is somewhat unsurprising, as
it might be considered not relevant to certain parts of the interview process,
However, when you compare it to whether individuals would bring up a physical
health issue in an interview (see [this notebook](INSERT LINK HERE), Figure 11),
it becomes apparent that there is a greater taboo around discussing mental
health than discussing physical health.

# Model Selection

Given all this evidence for a taboo around mental health in the technology
workplace, I wanted to use a method that would take our responses on mental
health in the workplace and segment them into interpretable narratives. I
decided to use a [latent class model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_class_model) 
(LCM) to create this segmentation.

For building a model around mental health in the workplace, I chose around $19$
questions that I felt were relevant to this topic. This includes questions such
as:

* Does your employer provide mental health benefits as part of healthcare
coverage?

* Do you know the options for mental health care available under your 
employer-provided coverage?

* Would you feel comfortable discussing a mental health disorder with your 
direct supervisor(s)?

* Do you feel that being identified as a person with a mental health issue 
would hurt your career?

I have listed all $18$ questions in [my git respository for the project](
https://github.com/PLBMR/mentalHealthDataAnalysis/blob/master/osmiMentalHealthInTech/data/preprocessed/variablesForClustering.txt).

(_Note: The rest of this section is rather technical. It is reasonable to skip
over it!_)

## Model Explanation

In the context of our survey, the LCM works as such:

* We have $18$ questions in the survey on mental health in the workplace. Each
individual submits answers $a_1,a_2,...,a_{18}$ to these questions respectively.

* There are $k$ perspectives on mental health in the workplace. Each perspective
$i$ carries an answer distribution $D_i.$ Hence, there are $D_1,D_2,...,D_k$
distributions, and each one is associated with a particular perspective.

* Our LCM assumes that each answer group $(a_1,a_2,...,a_{18})$
comes from an answer distribution of a particular perspective. For instance, if
an individual's answers are $(a_1,a_2,...,a_{18}) \sim D_1$, then these 
answers come from perspective $1$.

* Our objective is to find the perspective assignment that best fits the
answers given by the respondents. The method we use to find this perspective
assignment is referred to as the [expected maximization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectationâ€“maximization_algorithm).

This objective that measures how well we fit the answers given by respondents
is referred to as the [Likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function).
The likelihood measures how likely our model generated the answers found.

## Selection Process

We perform the following steps to select our latent class model:

1. We first split our dataset randomly into a selection set and an inference
set. We will use the selection set for solely building our final model, and we
will fit this model to the inference set for interpreting aspects of our model.

2. For selection, we will consider LCMs of between $1$ and $10$ classes. In this
context, this is considering LCMs with up to $10$ perspectives on mental health
in the workplace. To measure the performance of each of these models, we will
benchmark them using five-fold [cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) on the
$\log$ of the likelihood of the data. We will choose the model with the
highest cross-validated log-Likelihood.

## Selection Results

![figure6](../figures/figure6.png)

_Figure 6: Our Cross-Validated Log-Likelihood on the number of classes
considered._

We see that the cross-validated log-likelihood increases until $3$ classes,
falters a bit after $3$ classes, and then drops significantly after $5$ classes.
Thus, we will select a latent class model with $3$ classes/perspectives.

# Inference

To recap, we chose a latent class model with $3$ classes to cluster the answers
to $18$ questions into different perspectives. Now that we have this model, it
is essential to interpret our model parameters in order to define what these
perspective clusters are in our dataset.

## Exploring the Clusters

![figure7](../figures/figure7.png)

_Figure 7: The prior probabilities on our classes/perspectives discovered by our
LCM_

We can interpret each of these probabilities as the chance that a randomly
picked respondent is assigned to a particular class. Thus, if we were to pull
a respondent at random, there is a $26.1\%$ chance of that respondent being from
class $1$.

We see that the largest class in our dataset is class $3$, with classes $1$ and
$2$ being smaller groups. We see that a random respondent has close to equal
chance of being either class $1$ or $2$.

I then studied the tables of class-conditional probabilities for answers to the
$18$ questions we clustered upon. I have left most of this analysis in my
[inference notebook](https://github.com/PLBMR/mentalHealthDataAnalysis/blob/master/osmiMentalHealthInTech/analysis/clusterAnalysis/clusterAnalysis_inference.ipynb),
But I think it would be useful to discuss some of these tables to make a claim
about the perspectives defined by our clusters.

![figure8](../figures/figure8.png)

_Figure 8: Class-Conditional Probabilities on whether or not a respondent's
employer provides mental health benefits as part of healthcare coverage._

In order to interpret this table, consider each row to represent a distribution
of answers given a class assignment to a respondent. For instance, given that a
respondent is assigned to class $1$, we are predicting that there is a $27.2\%$
chance that they would respond "No" to this question and a $11.7\%$ chance that
they would respond "Yes" to this question.

We see that Class $2$ primarily answers "Yes" on this question, while Classes
$1$ and $3$ generally emphasizes the other possible answers. Thus, class $2$
looks to represent individuals who are often have coverage for mental 
healthcare while classes $1$ and $3$ represent individuals who either uncommonly
or rarely have coverage for mental healthcare.

![figure9](../figures/figure9.png)

_Figure 9: Class-Conditional Probabilities on whether discussing a mental
health disorder with one's employer would have negative consequences._

We see that classes $1$ and $2$ generally believe that there won't be negative
consequences for discussing mental health with one's employer, while class $3$
leans towards the answers of "maybe" and "yes." Thus, this suggests that classes
$1$ and $2$ have generally more support on mental health from their employers
than class $3$.

![figure10](../figures/figure10.png)

_Figure 10: Class-Conditional Probabilities on answers to the question
"Would you feel comfortable discussing a mental health disorder with your 
direct supervisor(s)?"_

We see that Class $2$ generally feels comfortable discussing mental health with
their direct supervisor(s). Class $1$ seems to feel "yes" or "maybe" comfortable
with this type of discussion, and Class $3$ generally does not seem comfortable
discussing mental health with a supervisor. Thus, this would suggest that
class $2$ faces high support over mental health with their direct supervisors,
and classes $1$ and $3$ face moderate and weak support respectively.

![figure11](../figures/figure11.png)

_Figure 11: Class-Conditional Probabilities on whether or not being identified
as a person with a mental health condition would hurt one's career._

We see that class $3$ generally thinks that this identification would hurt their
career, while classes $1$ and $2$ generally think that it would only "maybe"
hurt their career or that it would not hurt their career.

## Defining the Clusters


## Predicting the Clusters

After defining our classes into three perspectives on the mental health
landscape in the workplace, I decided that I wanted to see what demographics of
the respondents informed which perspective the respondent was assigned to. I
decided to consider the following variables in predicting our cluster
assignment:

* **gender**:
Gender of the Respondent (see [here](https://github.com/PLBMR/mentalHealthDataAnalysis/blob/master/osmiMentalHealthInTech/data/preprocessed/genderCountFrame.csv) for our mapping).

* **age**: Age of the Respondent.

* **companySize**: The company size of the respondent's employer.

* **isUSA**: Whether or not the respondent works in the United States.

* **diagnosedWithMHD**: Whether or not the respondent has been diagnosed 
with a mental health condition.

Note that these variables are very similar to our features and target variable
used in our [previous analysis](https://medium.com/@tfluffm/data-and-mental-health-the-osmi-survey-2016-39a3d308ac2f).

### Building the Model

_(Note: This section is also very technical. Feel free to skip it if you would
like!)_

Similar to our previous analysis, I decided to predict cluster assignment of
the respondents using [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)
and [multinomial logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression).
A multinomial regression is essentially a [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)
but for multiple classes as a target variable. Since we have $3$ different
classes to predict, it is essential that we use models that can handle multiple
choices for outcomes.

Since we have already performed a sizable data split, I found that performing
an additional data split for our model selection in this context would be
inappropriate. This is partially because if we do an additional data split on
the inference set, we would only have a few hundred survey responses to select
our final model.

We fit our decision tree by splitting using a deviance criterion. We fit our
multinomial logistic regression using a forward-backward [stepwise
selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression) procedure over
all linear and interaction effects of our variables.

![figure12](../figures/figure12.png)

_Figure 12: Our decision tree fitted on the inference set._

We see that our decision tree seems to consider **isUSA**, **diagnosedWithMHD**,
**companySize**, and **age** when considering its decision. That being said, one
point of concern is the fact that it seems to never predict class assignment $2$
in the data. This to some extent makes its utility rather meagre, as we have a
whole perspective that simply is not informed by these variables.

Our final multinomial logistic regression ended up including **age**,
**gender**, **isUSA**, **companySize**, **diagnosedWithMHD**,
and the interaction between **age** and **diagnosedWithMHD**.

Upon studying the accuracy of our models, I found that the multinomial
regression is about $52.9\%$ accurate to the data and the decision tree is about
$54.6\%$ accurate to the data. Since I am looking to reduce overfitting and I
would prefer a model that predicts class assignment $2$, I decided to select the
multinomial logistic regression in this context.

### Studying the Model

For those who skipped the technical details of our previous section, we
developed a multinomial regression to predict our class assignment using
**gender**, **isUSA**, **companySize**, **diagnosedWithMHD**, and the
interaction between **age** and **diagnosedWithMHD**.

As discussed before, our model's accuracy on the inference set is around
$52.9\%$. This is a generally poor fit, as we are performing only slightly
better than if we predicted class assignment $3$ for all of our respondents
(see Figure 7).

![figure13](../figures/figure13.png)

_Figure 13: The confusion matrix for our model._

We see that our model is doing an extremely poor job at predicting class
assignment $2$ as it looks like we are getting $\frac{4}{122 + 4 + 10}
\approx 2.9\%$ of our predictions correct for class assignment $2$. In
particular, it seems as though our model is overpredicting class $3$ for most of
our observations. This is likely due to our classes being imbalanced, since
the class $3$ label occurs much more often in our dataset than class $1$ and $2$
observations.

![figure14](../figures/figure14.png)

_Figure 14: Our Coefficient Table for our multinomial classifier_

We see that our location effect predicts that those working in the USA are much
more likely to be in class $2$ and slightly more likely to be in class $3$ than
those working outside of the United States. We also see that a diagnosis is
predicted to have a slight polarizing effect on perspectives, as we are 
predicting that it will severely increase assignment to classes $2$ and $3$
over class $1$. We also see that as company size grows larger, the likelihood of
being assigned to class $2$ is predicted to increase, which suggests that as
companies grow bigger, it is predicted that employees find that more of a 
support system for mental health exists in the workplace.

What also becomes clear is a very important gender effect. We see that women
are predicted to be $e^{.313} = 1.367$ times more likely to be assigned class $3$
than men. This means that a given woman is predicted to on average be $36.7\%$
more likely to be in class $3$ than an equivalent man. When we see that the
gender effect for women on class assignment $2$ is quite small, the implication
of this is that women are much more likely to feel a lack of good support
systems over mental health in the workplace than men.

The age effect is rather interesting. Consider a case where an individual is
not diagnosed with a mental health condition. An additional year of age is
predicted to multiplicatively increase the probability of an assignment to
classes $2$ and $3$ by $e^{.0666} = 1.069$ and $e^{.0597} = 1.0615$
respectively. This means that each additional year is predicted to increase
the chance of these assignments by about $6.9\%$ and $6.2\%$ respectively. This
would suggest that as non-diagnosed individuals get older, there is a
dichotomizing effect. They either find there is a strong support system that
exists for mental health in the workplace or they find that there is a weak 
support system.

Let's do some point comparisons based on some relevant demographics. We will 
limit this part of the analysis to US workers at large companies. We will start 
by studying individuals of average age.

![figure15](../figures/figure15.png)

_Figure 15: Class Assignment Predictions for US workers at large firms of
average age in our survey._

We see that across the board, our model overwhelmingly predicts a class
assignment of $3$ for this age group. Thus, for average-age US workers at large
firms, we are predicting that they are likely to feel weak support over mental
health in the workplace. We also see that those who are diagnosed with a
mental health condition are predicted to be much less likely to be in class
$1$ than their equivalent non-diagnosed counterparts. This confirms some of the
dichotomizing aspects of mental health conditions on perspectives of support.

We see the gender effect between men and women is noticeable in this context.
In particular, diagnosed women in this demographic are predicted to be
${.44 - .36}{.44} \approx 18.18\%$ less likely to be in class $2$ and
${.59 - .51}{.51} = 15.68\%$ more likely to be in class $3$ than equivalent
men. 

# Discussion

What is important to see is that our class model predicts that more individuals
believe that the support systems on mental health in the workplace are poor
than believe the support systems are moderate or strong. In fact, our model
predicts that there are as many individuals believing the former perspective
than the two other perspectives combined. This would suggest that the industry
as a whole has a long way to go to completely address mental health in the
workplace.

The diagnosis effect is very strong, as it pushes individuals away from a
perspective of feeling moderately supported and polarizes groups towards
feeling either highly or weakly supported on mental health care. This is likely
due to the fact that being diagnosed with a mental health condition makes you
more attuned to the mental health resources available in your environment. In
this sense, it could be that a mental health diagnosis makes one more sensitive
to the resources and support available in the workplace, which could drive a
non-neutral opinion about a company's mental health landscape. This may be
important for companies to tap into when responding to feedback about mental
health support systems in the workplace.

Just like in our previous analysis, the gender effect is rather key to study.
This gender effect suggests that women are more likely to find mental
health support systems to be weak than men. Also like our previous analysis,
there are perhaps two explanations to this effect. There is the possibility that
women are given fewer support systems over mental health than men. That being
said, there is also the possibility that women are more sensitive to the mental
health resources available in a workplace than men. The later explanation could
potentially be supported by the fact that in our previous analysis, we found
that women are more likely to claim a mental health diagnosis than men. It would
be interesting to study this effect further using adjustments to our model and
studying the causal mechanisms that link diagnosis and gender with these
perspectives.

The company size effect should also be taken into account. In particular, we
are predicting that as companies get larger, their employees are predicted to
be more likely to feel a sense of strong support over mental health in the
workplace. The likely narrative about this is that larger companies may have
the financial resources that smaller companies don't have to better support
mental health in the workplace. That being said, this doesn't account for some
of the taboos that exist about mental health when considering the opinions of
colleagues and supervisors of a worker. It's also important to note that larger
companies may have bureaucratic structures in place that would prevent
individuals from easily accessing these resources, which is counter to the
predictive effect we have discovered. To study this effect in more detail, we
may need a **companySize** variable with more granularity and a deeper
understanding of the mental health resources provided by major companies in the
tech industry.

# Limitations

There are several limitations that should be addressed:

* It is possible that are LCM is not well-specified. In particular, it assumes
that each answer to the questions clustered by an LCM are conditionally
independent given the class assignment. It is very possible that a respondents
answers are highly correlated with each other even within a particular
perspective, and it might be important to consider models that account for this
issue.

* Our model to predict class assignment is currently very poor, and it generally
overpredicts the perspective of low support over mental health in the workplace.
It may be important to consider what other demographics might be needed to
better inform the perspectives of individuals on this topic.

* The interaction between age and diagnosis may be currently spurious. In
particular, it isn't considering how people are diagnosed at particular ages,
and thus perspectives may be formed at particular ages based on when they are
diagnosed rather than just on the age itself.

# Future Work

There are some components to consider for further analysis:

* Having more demographics to predict our class assignment would be useful for
improving this analysis. Most notably, marital status or having children may
make one more sensitive to the mental health resources available. Education
and parental background may also impact these perspectives.

* There is some language data on individual's perspectives on mental health in
the industry. While I left it out of this analysis to prevent over-complication,
it might be useful to mine this language data for further narratives about
the issue.

* It might also be useful to compare the cluster assignment of the $2014$ survey
to the current survey in order to study how perspectives on this issue change
over time.
