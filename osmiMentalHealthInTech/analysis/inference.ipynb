    "\n",
    "$$P(diagnosedWithMHD_i | X) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\hat{r}(X)}},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{r}(X)$ is the fitted regression function that contains the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```age```: covers the age of a respondent.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```roleType```: engages the role type of a respondent at work, which can either be technical, non-technical, or both (i.e. hybrid roles).\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```isUSA```: asks if the individual works in the USA or not (1 if they do, 0 if they don't).\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```gender```: the gender that the individual identifies with. For the sake of simplification, we say that an individual is give \"F\" if they identify as a female, \"M\" if they identify as a male, and \"O\" if they identify as another gender not along the binary. We had to do this pooling for \"O\" since there were unfortunately only a small number of observations that did not identify along the gender binary.\n",

    "\n",

This may suggest that we simply aren't fitting the data extremely well, and that it might be essential to go back into the survey and find other variables that would be strong predictors of this outcome. We could also be dealing with the question of simply not asking all the questions we need to get a full picture of someone's mental health (e.g. how are there eating habits, what are there hours like at work, what is their social life like, etc). We may be able to get some more meaningful statements about factors contributing to mental health in tech if we asked some of these questions.\n",
