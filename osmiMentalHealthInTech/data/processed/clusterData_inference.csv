I can adapt quickly to jobs involving heavy lifting, for example, but would not admit that it would probably wind me to start with.  Most physical health issues severe enough to discuss are visible, and if they are not (say I have cancer and am going to be going on chemo) I would not discuss because of huge possibility of not being hired due to potential for medical leave / lots of absence.  ",2,"Mental health issues are hugely stigmatized.  I made the mistake of letting my last employer find out that I had ADHD and an adderall prescription not really thinking about it.  The head of engineering would joke about me ""doing meth"" after that at horrible moments including me (I have no degree) interviewing a PhD candidate who had done groundbreaking work in SMP and threaded rendering at SGI in the 90s and was all around awesome.  Luckily he made a joke about not talking about the shrooms he did to lighten that one, but there were many worse situations.  I was considered one of the most valued employees because of my ability to get anything done with the LLVM compiler system.  One day I pointed out to the manager in question that he was on a higher dosage of the same medication I was on, and the stupid meth jokes got worse from there.  It's not really a light accusation to make on somebody given our country's state of drug law, something which I am something of an activist for reform of.  It was was degrading. I was also made fun of for being autistic despite that not being a disorder I have.  ",5,1,3,35,"Male","United States of America"
